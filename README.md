Practicing with github
Hello Mission to Mars!



This is the readme. Formatting of text is as follows.
\# Largest Heading
\## Smaller heading
\### Smaller again
\*\*Bold Text\*\*
\*italics\*
>Quoted text


Coded text with back ticks before and after

```
Each time I edit in notepad, save then at command line:

git status

git add .

git commit -m "This is code text formatting"

```

Then git push origin main

## Git and Github for Remote Mission to Mars
This took a lot longer than I thought and I had to look up some steps on the internet why I couldn't find my README file. It had been created in the /ssh folder not the Mission to Mars folder so deleted it from there and recreated it in the right place.
