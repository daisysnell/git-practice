Practicing with github
Hello Mission to Mars!



This is the readme. Formatting of text is as follows.



\# Largest Heading

\## Smaller heading

\### Smaller again



\*\*Bold Text\*\*

\*italics\*

>Quoted text



Coded text with back ticks before and after

```

git status

git add .

git commit -m "This is code text formatting"

```

That didn't work first time
I think it is two asterixis for **Bold Text**
