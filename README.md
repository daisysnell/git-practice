# git-practice

Practicing with github
Hello Mission to Mars!



This is the readme. Formatting of text is as follows.
\# Largest Heading
\## Smaller heading
\### Smaller again
\*\*Bold Text\*\*
\*italics\*
>Quoted text


Coded text with back ticks before and after

```
Each time I edit in notepad, save then at command line:

git status

git add .

git commit -m "This is code text formatting"

```

Then git push origin main

# Setting up Git and Github
This took a lot longer than I thought and I had to get some help from my Mum. We looked up the steps on the internet because we couldn't find my README file and the key string wasn't being created. That was because the version of git is newer than the one in the instructions. 

## Story_1 Tinkercad practice
I had to make sure everything was connected to the right pins and the variables matched the right numbers. I **liked** the coding part and working out how to make it flash in different sequences.
